# Migrating from Other Agent Frameworks

If you're coming from other agent frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, or AutoGen, this guide will help you translate your existing implementations into idiomatic Playbooks code. **You can expect 60-90% reduction in code size** and significant reduction in complexity.

## Why Migrate to Playbooks?

| Benefit                    | Description                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **10x less code**          | Eliminate boilerplate and framework complexity          |
| **Natural language first** | Write agent behavior in plain English                   |
| **Soft + hard logic**      | Seamlessly mix LLM reasoning with deterministic Python  |
| **Verifiable execution**   | Compiled to auditable PBAsm for debugging               |
| **First principles**       | Built from the ground up for the LLM era (Software 3.0) |
| **No framework lock-in**   | Natural language programs are portable                  |

## Supported Source Frameworks

Playbooks can express the same agent behaviors as these popular frameworks:

| Framework                                                                 | Type                        | Playbooks Advantage                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)**                | State graph-based agents    | Replace complex state graphs with natural language workflows |

| **[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)**                       | Multi-agent conversations   | Simpler agent communication with triggers                    |
| **[LangChain Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/)** | Classic agent patterns      | Natural language replaces chain composition                  |
| **[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/)** | AI orchestration SDK        | Direct LLM execution vs orchestration layer                  |
| **[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/)**                              | NLP with agent capabilities | Focused on agents, not general NLP                           |
| **[AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT)**            | Autonomous agents           | Structured playbooks vs autonomous loops                     |

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Understand Your Agent's Behavior

Before migrating code, understand:

- What does the agent do?
- What are the key workflows?
- What tools/functions does it use?
- How do agents communicate (if multi-agent)?

**Focus on behavior, not framework mechanics.**

### Step 2: If using AI coding assistants

1. Configure your AI assistant: See [Writing with AI Assistants](../ai-assistants/)

1. Ask the AI assistant to convert the source implementation to Playbooks with the following prompt:

   ```text
   You are a ... <instructions from "Writing with AI Assistants" document>

   Read source implementation at <agent>.py carefully. Write an equivalent Playbooks program in playbooks/<agent>.pb. Create all new files in the playbooks/ folder, including mcp.py using fastmcp if necessary.
   ```

   Use appropriate name for and put in the [base instructions](../ai-assistants/).

### Step 3: If doing manual conversion

Use this mapping to translate concepts:

| Source Framework | Concept                           | Playbooks Equivalent           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **LangGraph**    | State graph                       | Agent with variables           |
|                  | Nodes                             | Individual playbooks           |
|                  | Edges                             | Control flow in Steps          |
|                  | State                             | Agent variables (`$variable`)  |
|                  | Tools                             | Python playbooks or MCP server |
| **CrewAI**       | Crew                              | Multi-agent program file       |
|                  | Agent roles                       | H1 agent definitions           |
|                  | Tasks                             | H2 playbook definitions        |
|                  | Tools                             | Python playbooks or MCP server |
|                  | Process (sequential/hierarchical) | Triggers and control flow      |
| **AutoGen**      | Agents                            | H1 agent definitions           |
|                  | Conversations                     | Agent messaging                |
|                  | Function calling                  | Python playbooks               |
|                  | Group chat                        | Multi-agent with triggers      |
| **LangChain**    | Agent                             | H1 agent definition            |
|                  | Tools                             | Python playbooks or MCP server |
|                  | ReAct agent                       | ReAct playbook type            |
|                  | Memory                            | Artifacts or variables         |
|                  | Chains                            | Playbook Steps                 |

### Step 4: Test and Iterate

Run your Playbooks agent:

```bash
cd playbooks
playbooks run <agent>.pb
```

Compare behavior with the original implementation and iterate.
