# Playbooks AI

> Build AI Agents with Natural Language Programming

Playbooks is an innovative framework for building and executing AI agents using "playbooks" - structured workflows defined in natural language and Python code. Created by Amol Kelkar, the framework is part of the world's first Software 3.0 tech stack, Playbooks AI. It includes a new programming language (markdown-formatted .pb files) that are compiled to Playbooks Assembly Language (.pbasm files), that are then executed by the Playbooks Runtime.
