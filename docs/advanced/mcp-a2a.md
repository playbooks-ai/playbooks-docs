# Playbooks via MCP and A2A Protocols

In order to align with the emerging ecosystem standards, Playbooks agents will speak the following two protocols, apart from a playbooks-native protocol that we think will lead to more capable multi-agent systems:

- [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/): Connects agents to tools, APIs, and resources with structured inputs/outputs. Think of it as the way agents access their capabilities.
- [Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://google.github.io/A2A/): Facilitates dynamic, multimodal communication between different agents as peers. It's how agents collaborate, delegate, and manage shared tasks.
