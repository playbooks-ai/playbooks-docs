# Observer Agents: The Missing Piece for Reliable, Accountable AI Systems

In the rush to build autonomous AI agents, much of the industry’s focus has been on *capability*: getting models to do more, faster. What has lagged behind is *control* — the ability to watch, guide, and correct these agents in real time. That is where **observer agents** come in.

An observer agent monitors another agent’s execution, step by step. It verifies that each action is correct before any side effects occur, and it keeps the bigger picture in mind, ensuring that the agent’s work aligns with longer-term goals. If something is wrong — whether it’s a factual error, a policy violation, or a deviation from plan — the observer steps in, corrects the course, and execution continues safely.

The research is clear: process supervision improves correctness and alignment; critic models can catch subtle errors humans miss; runtime “shields” can block unsafe actions before they happen. The need for live oversight is not theoretical — it is the difference between trust and risk in production AI systems.

## Why Playbooks Is a Natural Fit

Playbooks AI already has many of the primitives needed for effective observer agents:

* **Step-level gating before side effects** — The Playbooks runtime cleanly separates LLM token generation from effectful execution, making it trivial to insert an observer between “intent” and “impact.”
* **Structured, interpretable programs** — Observers themselves can be written as playbooks, giving them the same transparency, version control, and auditability as the agents they supervise.
* **Specialized low-latency models** — Observer behavior playbooks can be executed with ultra-fast LLMs that approve correct steps instantly and intervene only when necessary, minimizing cost and delay.
* **Portable, composable policies** — With public and exported playbooks, observer playbooks and agents can be shared across agents — a compliance team could publish a “privacy observer” that any trusted agent can use.
* **Protocol readiness** — Through the proposed Playbooks Protocol, an observer could monitor *remote* agents, subscribing to their proposed actions and issuing approvals or corrections in real time.

This is not a bolt-on idea for Playbooks — it is an organic extension of the design philosophy: keep the specification human-readable, the execution verifiable, and the control points programmable.

## The Plan

We intend to formalize observer agents in Playbooks by publishing a **specification for observer hooks** in PBAsm. These hooks will let an observer:

1. Inspect the next proposed step from an agent before execution.
2. Approve, patch, or reject the step, with an optional rationale.
3. Optionally run longer-horizon evaluations on plan adherence, resource use, or strategic objectives.

Our initial release will ship with reference observers for common needs — schema validation, policy enforcement, plan alignment — and a mechanism for packaging these as *exported observer playbooks* that anyone can bring into their own agents. Over time, we expect a marketplace of observer “policy packs” to emerge, from domain-specific QA to brand safety modules.

## Looking ahead

This is where we see the space heading:

* **From ad-hoc guardrails to portable observers** — Organizations will want to take their governance logic with them, not rebuild it in each agent framework.
* **Specialized critic models at the edge** — Ultra-light evaluators will run in real time, escalating to larger models only when confidence drops.
* **Hybrid oversight loops** — Combining deterministic checks, rubric-driven LLM critics, and human escalation for high-impact actions.
* **Observer collaboration** — Just as agents can work together, observers will coordinate too — cross-verifying each other’s judgments, aggregating signals, and preventing bias or collusion, with the logic for collaboration being defined as meeting playbooks.
* **Standardization of oversight APIs** — Much like MCP and A2A are standardizing agent communication, observer protocols will standardize how any compliant runtime can expose checkpoints for inspection and control. This

If autonomous AI is to scale safely, it needs more than raw intelligence — it needs a nervous system for oversight. Playbooks, with its separation of intent from action, structured and shareable logic, and forthcoming observer hooks, is in a unique position to deliver that nervous system.

We believe the next generation of AI systems will be judged not just by *what* they can do, but by *how well* they can prove they did it right. Observer agents make that possible.
