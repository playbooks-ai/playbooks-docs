# Dynamic Playbook Rewriting (Roadmap)

Dynamic Playbook Rewriting is an advanced feature in Playbooks AI that enhances adaptive behavior by continuously monitoring, revising, and executing generated playbooks in real-time. This capability ensures that agent behaviors remain coherent and optimal, even as circumstances change during the execution of complex, long-running processes.

## How it works

### Initial playbook generation

An agent first generates an initial playbook through a process involving deep reasoning and structured planning:

* Contextual assessment and comprehensive planning define a coherent initial strategy.
* A dynamic playbook is generated, detailing actionable, sequential steps.

### Active monitoring by observer agent

Once the generated playbook begins execution, an Active Observer Agent continuously evaluates each step:

* Assesses whether the current and upcoming steps remain valid and effective.
* Monitors ongoing relevance considering evolving context and objectives.

### Abortion and rewriting

When an Observer Agent identifies steps that are no longer applicable or effective:

* The ongoing execution of the current playbook is immediately halted.
* A new reasoning and planning cycle commences, recalibrating the agent's strategy based on current conditions.
* A revised playbook is generated, integrating real-time insights and updated objectives.

### Execution of revised playbooks

After rewriting, the agent seamlessly transitions into executing the newly generated playbook:

* Ensures continuity in long-running agent processes without losing strategic coherence.
* Repeated cycles of rewriting guarantee continually optimized and contextually appropriate behavior.

## Use Cases

* **Long-term Autonomous Operations**: Ensuring ongoing coherence in tasks like autonomous fleet management or logistics.
* **Adaptive Research Processes**: Dynamically rewriting experimental protocols based on emerging data and interim findings.
* **Real-time Strategic Games**: Adjusting complex strategies mid-game in response to evolving opponent behaviors.
