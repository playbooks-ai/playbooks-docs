# Getting Started with Playbooks AI

Playbooks AI is a framework for building AI agents using natural language programming. It allows you to create AI agents that can understand and execute natural language instructions, interact with users, and call Python functions seamlessly.

## What are Playbooks?

Playbooks are procedures that define the behavior of AI agents. They can be written as:

1. **Natural language instructions** - Step-by-step instructions for prescribed business processes
2. **Agentic prompts** - Prompt-based playbooks for dynamically planned tasks where the AI agent decides the next steps
3. **Python functions** - Python functions that can be called from playbooks and can call playbooks

## Installation

To get started with Playbooks AI, you need to install the `playbooks` package:

```bash
pip install playbooks
```

## Core Concepts

Playbooks AI is built around these core concepts:

- **Playbooks Language**: The natural language programming syntax
- [**Agent Framework**](../agents/index.md): The environment that Playbooks programs run in
- [**Playbooks Runtime**](../runtime/index.md): Manages interpreter, control flow, variables, artifacts, etc.
- [**Triggers**](../triggers/index.md): Event-driven programming through natural language conditions
- [**Artifacts**](../artifacts/index.md): Store and access data from playbooks
