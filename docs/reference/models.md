# Models

Playbooks is tested and optimized for the following models:

- Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 ("claude-haiku-4-5-20251001")
- Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 ("claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")
- Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 ("claude-sonnet-4-20250514")
- PlaybooksLM

Playbooks framework uses complex prompts that are optimized for Anthropic models. As a result, other frontier LLMs such as GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 4 may work, but additional testing and tuning may be required. Our current focus is on improving the core capabilities of the framework and demonstrating a novel way of programming AI agents. We plan to add testing and support for other models gradually. 

:bulb: As of Nov 2025, we recommend using Haiku 4.5 for experimentation and development.

For production use, you may continue using Haiku 4.5 or switch to PlaybooksLM for lower latency, lower cost and full control over data privacy & security. PlaybooksLM is a proprietary, Enterprise-grade model developed by Playbooks AI. Please contact us at [contact@runplaybooks.ai](mailto:contact@runplaybooks.ai) for more information.
