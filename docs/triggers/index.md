# Triggers

Triggers are a powerful feature in Playbooks AI that enable declarative event-driven programming through natural language conditions. They allow playbooks to be dynamically invoked when specified conditions are met.

## What are Triggers?

Triggers are conditions written in natural language that, when met, cause a playbook to be executed. They enable reactive and event-driven behavior in your AI agents.

## Benefits of Triggers

Triggers provide several advantages:

- **Reactive Programming**: Build systems that respond to events without polling
- **Separation of Concerns**: Organize code around events rather than control flow
- **Natural Language Expressiveness**: Specify complex conditions in plain language
- **Reduced Complexity**: Avoid complex if-else chains and state management
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Create loosely coupled components that interact through events
