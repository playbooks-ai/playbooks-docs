# Part 1 – User interaction

Audience: Beginners

Goal: Build an interactive agent that asks and responds to the user.

## Run the example

```bash
playbooks run tests/data/02-personalized-greeting.pb
```

Observe:

- The agent asks for your name
- You reply; it greets you by name

Concepts:

- Say and Wait for user input
- Variables to store user data
