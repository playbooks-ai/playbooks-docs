# Part 2 – Triggers

Audience: Beginners → Intermediate

Goal: Use triggers to control when playbooks run.

## Run the examples

Start with basic triggers:

```bash
playbooks run tests/data/06-triggers.pb -v
```

Explore execution modes:

```bash
playbooks run tests/data/07-execution-modes.pb -v
```

Concepts:

- “At the beginning”
- Condition‑based triggers
- Execution modes and implications
